# Python Algorithms Tutorial

This project is a collection of various algorithms implemented in Python. It serves as a tutorial for understanding and utilizing fundamental algorithms in programming.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Fibonacci**: Computes the nth Fibonacci number.
2. **Factorial**: Calculates the factorial of a given number.
3. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Finds the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
4. **Prime Checking**: Determines if a number is prime.
5. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit.
6. **Binary Search**: Searches for a target value in a sorted array.
7. **Merge Sort**: Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd python-algorithms-tutorial
```

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests

To ensure that all algorithms work as expected, unit tests are provided. You can run the tests using pytest:

```bash
pytest tests/test_algorithms.py
```

## Usage

You can import the algorithms in your Python scripts as follows:

```python
from src.algorithms import fibonacci, factorial, gcd, is_prime, sieve_of_eratosthenes, binary_search, merge_sort
```

Feel free to explore and modify the algorithms as needed!
