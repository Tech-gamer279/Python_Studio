# You can use this code to do arithmetic operations in python.

# Arithmetic operations in Python
# This code snippet demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Python.
# Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Define two numbers
num1 = 10
num2 = 5    
# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2  
# Modulus operation
modulus = num1 % num2

# Exponentiation
exponentiation = num1 ** num2

# Floor division
floor_division = num1 // num2

# Print the results
print(f"Addition: {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction: {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication: {multiplication}")
print(f"Division: {division}")
print(f"Modulus: {modulus}")
print(f"Exponentiation: {exponentiation}")
print(f"Floor Division: {floor_division}")

# This code snippet provides a basic overview of arithmetic operations in Python.
# You can modify the values of `num1` and `num2` to perform operations with different numbers.
# You can also add more operations or functions as needed.
# Remember to run this code in a Python environment to see the results.
# Happy coding!
